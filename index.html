        <center> <h1>My College Journey &amp; Goals</h1></center> 
        <p style="color:#d1106dec;">Hi, I’m <font color="#6a0dad"><b><i>Zahra Batool</i></b></font>, a <b><i>Communication Design</i></b>
            major at City Tech. I transferred from QCC after finishing my 
            associate’s and am now working toward the BFA, so I’m 
            basically a <i>junior</i>. My first semester here was rough, 
            but this one is off to a better start. I’m on campus 
            three days a week; Tuesdays are the longest (12–9 p.m.),
            and the <i>two-hour commute</i> each way gets tough sometimes, 
            but I feel steadier overall. Looking ahead, I want to blend 
            my passion for darkroom photography and videography with my 
            path as a graphic designer and motion-graphics animator. 
            I plan to pursue internships in these areas to see how real 
            studios operate, develop my own style, and ultimately grow 
            into an art director.</p>
